## Overview
---
In this project, my goal is to build a Convolutional Neural Network (ConvNet) model in TensorFlow to classify Traffic Sign images. The project uses the German Traffic Sign Dataset to train, validate, and test the model. Finally, the project also attempts to classify random German Traffic Sign images found on the web.

## The Project
---

**The goals / steps of this project are the following:**
* Load the German Traffic Sign Dataset
* Explore, summarize and visualize the data set
* Design, train and test a model architecture
* Use the model to make predictions on new images
* Analyze the softmax probabilities of the new images
* Summarize the results with a written report

## Dataset
---

The data set used is the German Traffic Sign Dataset.
#### [Link to Dataset](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-selfdrivingcar/traffic-signs-data.zip) used for the project. This is a pickled dataset with images resized to 32x32.
